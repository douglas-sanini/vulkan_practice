# Vulkan Learning Project Devlog

Welcome to my Vulkan Learning Project! This repository is a space for me to document my progress and experiences as I dive into the Vulkan API using C++. My goal is to learn the intricacies of graphics programming and build a strong foundation in this area.

## 🚀 Project Overview

I’m exploring Vulkan, a modern graphics and compute API, to understand how to create efficient and high-performance graphics applications. As I progress, I will be implementing various rendering techniques and sharing insights along the way.

## 🛠️ Current Progress

### Triangle Rendering Script

- **Date:** [Oct 26, 2024]
- **Details:** I've started developing a script to render a triangle on the screen. While it’s still in its early stages, I am laying out the essential components needed for rendering, such as:
  - Creating a vertex buffer
  - Setting up shaders
  - Basic command buffer management

### Setup Script

- **Date:** [Oct 22, 2024]
- **Details:** I created a setup script that initializes the Vulkan environment, including instance creation and setup for the graphics pipeline. This script lays the groundwork for subsequent rendering tasks.

### Challenges Faced

- Understanding Vulkan’s verbose setup process compared to other graphics APIs has been a challenge, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it.
- Debugging the initial setup has required patience, especially ensuring that all extensions and layers are correctly enabled.

## 📅 Next Steps

1. **Complete the Triangle Rendering:** Focus on implementing the drawing commands to render the triangle effectively.
2. **Shader Development:** Begin writing and integrating shaders to enhance the triangle's appearance.
3. **Pipeline Optimization:** Explore ways to optimize the rendering pipeline for better performance and efficiency.
